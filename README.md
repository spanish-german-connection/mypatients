# Mypatients Api

This api was created as part of the Web Development Bootcamp from Ironhack, to practice the concepts learnt during the module 3 of the Bootcamp to implemented an application based on the MERN Stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node).

## How to run this application

In order to run this application you need to add this environment variable to the platform where the site will be running:

```
- TOKEN_SECRET: The key for encrypting the token
- MONGODB_URI: The mongodb atlas connection string for the database
- ORIGIN: The origin or domain of the react application to enable CORS policy
```

# Demo

The live api is running in [https://adaptable.io/](https://adaptable.io/) and published with Postman [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/992211/2s8YYCsjmw#b7deafc8-35b8-470e-806b-59b3f87cf15b) so it can be tested by anyone
